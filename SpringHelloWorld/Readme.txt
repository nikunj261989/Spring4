This example shows Spring 4 Hello world Annotation using Spring Annotation

@Configuration declares a class as a Spring Configuration class which can contain @Bean annotated methods 
generating bean definitions managed by Spring container. 

AnnotationConfigApplicationContext creates Spring Application Context accepting input as our configuration 
class annotated with @Configuration, registering all the beans generated by the configuration class in Spring runtime. 

Once we got the context configured, we can use getBean method to fetch a specific bean from Spring application context 
and perform some action on that
